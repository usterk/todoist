# Implement End-to-End (E2E) Testing Framework

## Metadata
* **Ticket ID:** TASK-020
* **Status:** backlog
* **Priority:** high
* **Assigned to:** copilot
* **Created on:** 2025-04-13
* **Changed on:** 2025-04-13

## Description
Implement a comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for the Todoist API to ensure all API endpoints function correctly in a real-world environment. This will validate the complete user flows and integration between different components of the system, ensuring that the application works as expected from a user's perspective.

E2E tests will complement our existing unit and integration tests by verifying that all components work together properly, especially the authentication middleware, database operations, and business logic flows.
