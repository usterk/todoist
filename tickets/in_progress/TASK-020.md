# Implement End-to-End (E2E) Testing Framework

## Metadata
* **Ticket ID:** TASK-020
* **Status:** in_progress
* **Priority:** high
* **Assigned to:** copilot
* **Created on:** 2025-04-13
* **Changed on:** 2025-04-15

## Description
Implement a comprehensive end-to-end (E2E) testing framework for the Todoist API to ensure all API endpoints function correctly in a real-world environment. This will validate the complete user flows and integration between different components of the system, ensuring that the application works as expected from a user's perspective.

E2E tests will complement our existing unit and integration tests by verifying that all components work together properly, especially the authentication middleware, database operations, and business logic flows.

## Project Documentation References
* Database documentation: /docs/database/README.md and /docs/database/schema.md
* Product Requirements Document (PRD): /docs/PRD.md
* API Documentation: /docs/api/README.md
* API Authentication Documentation: /docs/api/authentication.md

## Implementation Details
We will implement an E2E testing framework using Python's pytest and the requests library for making HTTP calls to the API. This approach provides a lightweight, maintainable solution that integrates well with our existing codebase and CI/CD pipeline.

Key components of implementation:

1. **Directory Structure**: Create a dedicated `tests/e2e` directory to separate E2E tests from unit tests
2. **Test Runner**: Update `run.sh` with specific commands for different testing scenarios
   - `test` - Run all tests (unit, integration, and E2E)
   - `unit-test` - Run only unit and integration tests
   - `e2e-test` - Start the app and run E2E tests against it
3. **GitHub Actions**: Create a dedicated workflow file for running E2E tests in CI
4. **Fixtures**: Create reusable test fixtures for API connections, authentication, and test data management

Environment handling:
- Docker testing will use Docker networking to connect between test container and API container
- CI testing will have the API started as a separate step in the workflow
- Test environment variables will control the base URL and other parameters

The first test implementation will be for the `/health` endpoint as a proof of concept, with plans to expand to authentication and functional endpoints in future tickets.
